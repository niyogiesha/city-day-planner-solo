# Project Management Plan (Solo)

## Tools
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub repo (public)
- **Issues/Tracking:** GitHub Issues + Milestones (use tasks from `docs/project_plan.csv`)
- **Workflow:** `main` branch protected; work on short-lived feature branches; use PRs even solo for history.
- **Communication:** Commit messages daily; brief daily note in `docs/daily_log.md`.

## Cadence
- Daily (15 min): run app, push anything changed, update plan/EV.
- Twice weekly: close issues, capture screenshots for Test Document.

## Definition of Done (per deliverable)
- **App:** GUI opens, Plan and Route buttons work, prints score & route, no crashes.
- **Plans:** CSVs filled with realistic dates; EV shows SPI/CPI >= 0.8 by final week.
- **Tests:** Evidence (screenshots + steps) for each rubric item.

## Submission Checklist
- README: quickstart, data sources, screenshots.
- `docs/`: updated CSV/MD, test doc exported to DOCX via Word/LibreOffice.
- Tag release `v1.0` and upload zip.
